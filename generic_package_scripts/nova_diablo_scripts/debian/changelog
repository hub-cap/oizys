nova (2011.1~bzr597-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  [ Chuck Short ]
  * New upstream snapshot.
  * Add socat, iscsiadm, and vgs to nova_sudoers.

  [ Soren Hansen ]
  * Add dependency on sudo.

  * Adjust test run for nosetests newness.
  * Quiet nova-compute's postinst script.
  * Change the dependency on sqlalchemy to ensure the C extension gets
    installed for versions of the package where that was split out.
  * Don't chgrp anything to the 'nogroup' group. The whole idea of the
    nogroup group is that it doesn't own anything, so only being a

    and files owned by nogroup messes this up.
  * Update nova-manage patch.
  * Add iptables-{restore,save} to sudoers file.

    service after rotation.

    have a consistent way of finding their flagfile.

  * nova-manage_flagfile_location.patch: Make sure nova-manage uses
    /etc/nova/nova.conf by default.
  * Add build and runtime dependency on openssl. It used to be pulled in
    by python-tornado, but is actually used directly by nova.

  [ Chuck Short ]

     doesnt complain about missing python modules when starting.
